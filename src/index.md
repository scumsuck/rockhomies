Welcome to the Rock Homies web directory.

This is a web directory/listing for fans and artists of rock + metal music.  I hope to build this site up so we can find and support each other on the worldwide web, off of social media.  I specifically want a place for people who make art, music, stories, and characters based on rock + metal music!

**Da rules:**
- I can ignore submissions from annoying people.  Annoying people include magas, gender criticals, varg fanboys, and anti/proship discoursers. 
- You must acknowledge ðŸ‘† RPF.  You don't have to like it.  You don't have to create it.  Just don't be a dick to people who happen to create fanart and fanfic about musicians.
- No gatekeeping.  The genres of rock and metal I use on this site are intentionally broad, and include foundational genres like jazz and blues, as well as "adjacent" genres of music like v-kei, emo, goth, and so on.  Basically if you like anything on the [Wikipedia page for Rock Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) you're fine.  Anything from The Beatles to Black Veil Brides is fine on top of boomer classics like Iron Maiden and Celtic Frost.

If you don't like these guidelines, that's fine.  Make your own web listing!  It's free!
