Welcome to the Rock Homies web directory.

## WHAT IS ROCK HOMIES?

This is a web directory/listing for fans and artists of rock + metal music.  I specifically want a place for people who make art, music, stories, and characters based on rock + metal music to find and support each other online, but off social media!

## WHAT IS ROCK and METAL?

The definition I'm using for rock and metal is intentionally broad.  Foundational genres like blues, jazz, etc are fine, adjacent genres like v-kei, emo, goth are fine.  Basically everything from The Beatles to Black Veil Brides, to Iron Maiden and Napalm Death, to whatever band only you know that only released 5 demos in 1987, is fine.  Nothing is too cringe or mainstream.  If you're a fan of Backstreet Boys or BTS or whatever that's cool too, as long as ROCK and METAL are also genres you enjoy.
