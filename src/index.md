Welcome to the Rock Homies web directory.

This is a web directory/listing for fans and artists of rock + metal music.  I hope to build this site up so we can find and support each other on the worldwide web, off of social media.  I specifically want a place for people who make art, music, stories, and characters based on rock + metal music!

**Da rules:**
- I can ignore whoever I want, which includes rude magas and terves and people who are weird about anti/proship bullshit. 
- You must acknowledge ðŸ‘† RPF.  You don't have to like it.  You don't have to create it.  Just don't be a dick to people who happen to create fanart and fanfic about musicians.
- No gatekeeping.  The genres of rock and metal I use on this site are intentionally broad, and include foundational genres like jazz and blues, as well as "adjacent" genres of music like v-kei, emo, goth, and so on.  Basically if you like anything on the [Wikipedia page for Rock Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) you're fine.  Anything from The Beatles to Black Veil Brides is fine on top of boomer classics like Iron Maiden and Celtic Frost.
